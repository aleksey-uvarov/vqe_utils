A collection of Qiskit-based modules I wrote to implement ansatz states for variational quantum eigensolver.

Overlaps a lot with <a href=https://github.com/Quantum-Machine-Learning-Initiative/learning-phases>this repository</a> supporting a paper we wrote. This one contains the modules that are reusable outside the scope of the paper.
